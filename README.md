# nameFlip

A simple static website application that does a name flip.

This is just to show some light programming skills I have developed as well as to showcase a dumb little thing my brain always does when I hear names.

You take the first letter/sound from the first and last names and swap them. 

That's it. 

For example, John Smith becomes Smohn Jith.
